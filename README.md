ATM Machine Simulation
Description
This project is a simple ATM Machine Simulation implemented in Java. It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as checking their account balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money. The program is designed to mimic the functionality of an ATM system, including PIN verification for secure access.

Features
Secure Login: Users must enter a PIN to access the menu.
Menu Options:
Check Balance: Displays the current account balance.
Withdraw Money: Withdraws a user-specified amount (if sufficient balance is available).
Deposit Money: Deposits a user-specified amount into the account.
Exit: Safely exits the system.
Validation: Ensures valid input and displays appropriate error messages.
Seamless Navigation: Returns to the main menu after each operation for ease of use.
How to Run
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans).
Run the ATMMACHINE class, which contains the main() method.
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the ATM simulation.
Code Structure
ATM Class:
Contains all the core methods for ATM functionality.
Handles PIN verification, balance checks, withdrawals, deposits, and menu navigation.
ATMMACHINE Class:
The entry point of the program, initializes the ATM object and starts the simulation.
Usage
Enter PIN:
Enter the predefined PIN (5678 by default).
If the PIN is incorrect, the program will prompt for the correct PIN.
Select Menu Options:
Choose any of the menu options to perform an operation.
Perform Transactions:
Deposit or withdraw money as needed.
Check your updated balance after each transaction.
Future Enhancements
Here are some features that can be added to improve the functionality:

Transaction History: Maintain a record of deposits and withdrawals.
Multiple Users: Support for multiple users with unique PINs and balances.
Daily Limits: Set daily withdrawal limits.
Interest Calculation: Simulate interest accumulation on account balances.
Denomination Display: Show denominations for withdrawn amounts.
Account Locking: Lock accounts after multiple failed PIN attempts.
Persistent Storage: Save user data to a file or database for persistence.
Sample Output
 
Enter your pin: 
5678
